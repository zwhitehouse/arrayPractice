# Self Evalution

-- I would say I feel pretty confident with arrays so far. I know there is more I can learn and will have to learn but I believe I have a decent grasp on the the subject so far.

--There is additional learning I will NEED to do before going further and I plan on doing so through my self learning sites and the help of my peers.

--I dont have any questions about arrays right now.
